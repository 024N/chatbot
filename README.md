There are 2 applications which are server app and client app.
Client app creates 1000 clients and these clients connect to the server.

First of all, we need to run our server,

# Run Server
..chatbot\server on this directory,
- npm install
- npm start

After than,

# Run Client creator
..chatbot\client on this directory,
- npm install
- npm start

and clients will be created and ring process will start.
