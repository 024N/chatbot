There are 2 applications which are server app and client app.
Client app creates 1000 clients and these clients connect to the server.

First of all, we need to run our server,
..chatbot\server on this directory,
npm install
npm start

After than,
..chatbot\client on this directory,
npm install
npm start

and clients will be created and ring process will start.
